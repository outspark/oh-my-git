삶은 위험으로 가득 차 있죠? 학교에 가는 도중에도, 많은 위험이 있는 것 같습니다!

이번 월요일은 특히 나빠요. 학교에 도착했지만, 분명히 없애고 싶은 타임라인이 있습니다.

[setup]

echo You leave your house and start walking to school. > you
git add .
git commit -m "Good morning!"

echo You walk on the right side of the street. >> you
git commit -am "Right side"

echo You jump over an manhole in the walkway, and arrive at school on time. >> you
git commit -am "Jump"

git checkout HEAD^ -b friend
echo Suddenly, you fall down, splash into stinking water, and are eaten by an alligator. >> you
git commit -am "A new friend"

git checkout HEAD~2 -b music
echo You walk on the left side of the street. >> you
git commit -am "Left side"

echo Because you\'re kind of late, you start running. Someone throws a piano out of their windows, and it smashes you. >> you
git commit -am "Sounds nice"

git checkout HEAD^ -b ice-cream
echo You\'re not in a hurry, and walk slowly. You even get some ice cream on your way. You arrive at school too late, your teacher is angry, and you are expelled. >> you
git commit -am "Yum"

git branch -M main leap
git checkout leap^^

[win]

# Find the bad branches and delete them. Keep only the best one.
test "$(git show-ref --heads | cut -f2 -d' ')" = "$(echo refs/heads/leap)"

[congrats]

다시 생각해보니, 얼음 사탕 타임라인이 주요 타임라인보다 더 나을지도 몰라요? :)
